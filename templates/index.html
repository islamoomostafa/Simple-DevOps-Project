    <h1>Project Details</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this project, I set up a complete development environment on AWS EC2. The project began with creating an Ubuntu instance, where I installed Jenkins, Docker, and Flask to develop a small Python application.</p>
    
    <h2>Steps Taken</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Setting Up AWS EC2 Instance</h3>
    <p>Created an Ubuntu instance on AWS EC2 to serve as the base environment for developing the application.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Installing Jenkins, Docker, and Flask</h3>
    <p>Installed Jenkins, Docker, and Flask on the instance to enhance the development and deployment process.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Configuring Jenkins Pipeline</h3>
    <p>Created a Jenkins Pipeline to link the project to GitHub and execute build, install, and run steps for the application.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Managing Dependencies Without Docker</h3>
    <p>Started with a requirements file to manage dependencies for running the application without using Docker.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Enhancing the Project with Docker</h3>
    <p>Enhanced the project by using Docker to simplify environment management and standardization. Created a Dockerfile to build a Docker image for the application.</p>
    
    <h3>6. Pushing the Docker Image to Docker Hub</h3>
    <p>Built a Docker image of the project and pushed it to Docker Hub to make it available for future use.</p>
    
    <h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Successfully set up a comprehensive development environment using AWS, Jenkins, Docker, and Flask, which improved project management and simplified deployment and future use.</p>
